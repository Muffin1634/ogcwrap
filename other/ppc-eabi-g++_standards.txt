# C
Replace `c` with `gnu` to enable GNU extensions for that standard; e.g. `-std=c17` becomes `-std=gnu17`.
Note that this does not apply to `iso9899:199409`.
```
-std=c90            Conform to the ISO 1990 C standard.

-std=c2x            Conform to the ISO 202X C standard draft (experimental and incomplete support).
```

# C++
Replace `c` with `gnu` to enable GNU extensions for that standard; e.g. `-std=c++17` becomes `-std=gnu++17`.
```
