Note: As of 10/21/21, this list is not being updated anymore. See the project board [here](https://github.com/Muffin1634/ogcwrap/projects/1) for the new list.


Also, special note for the doxygen: If you see some documentation that I wrote that says I don't fully understand what something is for, but you know some things that aren't written there, feel free to make a PR adding it! I'd like this documentation to be as complete as possible ðŸ™‚

I'll eventually get around to researching the rest at some point
